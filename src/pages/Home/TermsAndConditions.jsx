                <Typography color="white" sx={{ mb: 4 }}>
                    Disputes or disagreements may occasionally arise during the course of participating in the Tuzo Za Tamthilia(Tuzo Za Tamthilia) voting system. To ensure fairness and clarity in resolving such matters, the following dispute resolution procedures are in place:<br />
                    1.	Internal Resolution Channels: Participants are encouraged to first attempt to resolve any disputes or concerns directly with the administrators of the Tuzo Za Tamthilia voting system. This can typically be achieved by contacting the designated support team via email, phone, or other specified communication channels. Administrators will make every effort to address inquiries promptly and provide appropriate assistance in resolving disputes.<br />
                    2.	Evidence Submission: In cases where disputes involve allegations of misconduct, fraud, or other irregularities, participants may be required to provide relevant evidence or documentation to support their claims. This may include screenshots, timestamps, transaction records, or any other information pertinent to the dispute. The administrators will carefully review the evidence provided and make a fair determination based on the available information.<br />
                    3.	Mediation and Negotiation: If initial attempts at resolving a dispute directly with the administrators prove unsuccessful, participants may request mediation or negotiation services to facilitate communication and reach a mutually acceptable resolution. Mediators or neutral third parties may be appointed to assist in facilitating constructive dialogue and finding common ground between the parties involved.<br />
                    4.	Arbitration: In cases where disputes cannot be resolved through negotiation or mediation, participants may agree to submit the matter to arbitration. Arbitration is a form of alternative dispute resolution where an impartial arbitrator or panel of arbitrators reviews the evidence presented by both parties and renders a binding decision. The decision of the arbitrator(s) is final and legally enforceable, and participants agree to abide by the outcome of the arbitration process.<br />
                    5.	Legal Recourse: Participants retain the right to pursue legal recourse through the judicial system if disputes cannot be resolved through internal channels, mediation, or arbitration. This may involve filing a lawsuit or seeking other legal remedies available under applicable laws and regulations. However, participants are encouraged to exhaust all available dispute resolution options before resorting to litigation, as it can be time-consuming, costly, and adversarial in nature.<br />
                    6.	Good Faith Cooperation: Throughout the dispute resolution process, participants are expected to act in good faith and cooperate fully with administrators, mediators, arbitrators, or other parties involved in resolving the dispute. This includes providing accurate information, adhering to deadlines, and refraining from engaging in retaliatory or adversarial behavior.
